Definition:
The static keyword in Java signifies that a member belongs to the class rather than any object of the class.

Static Variables:
Shared across all instances of the class, they retain their values throughout the program.

Static Methods:
Can be called without creating an object and are used to perform tasks that do not require access to instance variables.

Static Block:
Executes once when the class is loaded, typically used for initializing static variables.

Memory Efficiency:
Static members are stored in the method area, reducing memory usage.

Accessing Static Members:
Accessed using the class name directly, though objects can also access them (not recommended).

No this or super:
Static methods and blocks cannot use this or super because they do not operate on instances.

Static Nested Class:
A class inside another class that can access only static members of the outer class.

Main Method:
Defined as static so the JVM can invoke it without creating an object.

Limitations:
Static methods cannot be overridden but can be hidden if redefined in a subclass.
