✅ Definition
Inheritance allows one class (child/subclass) to acquire properties and behavior (methods) from another class (parent/superclass).

It promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy.

🎯 Key Concepts
Superclass/Parent Class: The class being inherited.

Subclass/Child Class: The class that inherits from the parent.

extends Keyword: Used to define inheritance.

📝 Types of Inheritance
Single Inheritance:

One child class inherits from one parent class.

Multilevel Inheritance:

A class inherits from a derived class.

Hierarchical Inheritance:

Multiple classes inherit from a single parent.

⚠️ Note:

Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity.

Multiple inheritance is achieved using interfaces.

🔥 Important Keywords
super Keyword:

Refers to the parent class and is used to access parent class methods or constructors.

this Keyword:

Refers to the current class instance.

final Keyword:

Prevents a class from being inherited or a method from being overridden.

⚡️ Method Overriding
Occurs when a subclass redefines a method from the parent class.

Ensures that the subclass method is invoked instead of the parent’s method.

Used for runtime polymorphism.

🔒 Access Modifiers in Inheritance
Public: Accessible everywhere.

Protected: Accessible within the package and subclasses.

Default: Accessible within the same package.

Private: Not accessible by child classes.

🧩 Constructor Behavior in Inheritance
A subclass constructor automatically calls the parent class constructor.

If the parent has a parameterized constructor, it must be explicitly called using super().

⚡️ Abstract Class and Inheritance
Abstract classes can be inherited but cannot be instantiated.

Subclasses must implement abstract methods.

🚫 Multiple Inheritance Limitation
Java prevents multiple inheritance using classes to avoid ambiguity.

It is supported through interfaces.

🎁 Advantages of Inheritance
Promotes code reusability.

Enhances maintainability and scalability.

Supports method overriding for dynamic method dispatch.
