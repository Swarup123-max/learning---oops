✅ Definition

Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data (variables) and methods into a single unit (class).

It restricts direct access to the data and promotes data security.

🎯 Key Concepts

Private Variables: Data is declared private to prevent direct access.

Public Methods: Getters and setters are used to access and modify private variables.

Class as a Capsule: Acts as a protective layer around the data.

⚡️ Purpose of Encapsulation

Protects data from unauthorized access.

Increases control over data.

Makes the code more maintainable and flexible.

📝 Access Control in Encapsulation

Private: Restricts access to class members.

Public Methods: Allow controlled access to private data.

🎁 Advantages of Encapsulation

Data Hiding: Protects internal data.

Flexibility: Modifications can be done without affecting other classes.

Improved Security: Only authorized access to data.

✅ Summary

Encapsulation ensures data safety and promotes clean and maintainable code.
