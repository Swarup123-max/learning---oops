### 🏗️ Constructors in Java - Key Notes  

---

✅ Definition  
- A constructor is a **special method** used to initialize objects.  
- It is invoked automatically when an object is created.  

---

🎯 Key Concepts  
- **Same Name as Class:** A constructor has the same name as the class.  
- **No Return Type:** Constructors do not have a return type.  
- **Automatic Invocation:** Called automatically when an object is instantiated.  

---

⚡️ Types of Constructors  
1. **Default Constructor:**  
   - No parameters.  
   - Initializes objects with default values.  
2. **Parameterized Constructor:**  
   - Accepts parameters to initialize objects with specific values.  
3. **Copy Constructor:**  
   - Creates a new object by copying values from another object.

📝 Key Characteristics  
- **Constructor Overloading:** Multiple constructors with different parameters.  
- **Cannot Be Inherited:** Constructors are not inherited by subclasses.  
- **Calls Parent Constructor:** `super()` can be used to call a parent class constructor.  

---

🎁 Advantages of Constructors  
- **Object Initialization:** Ensures proper initialization of objects.  
- **Code Reusability:** Avoids repetitive initialization code.  
- **Improved Readability:** Simplifies object creation.  

---

✅ Summary  
- Constructors ensure efficient object initialization and promote cleaner, more maintainable code.
